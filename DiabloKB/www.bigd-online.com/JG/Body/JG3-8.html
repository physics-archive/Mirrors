<div class=Section>3.8 Item creation in dungeon</div><br>

<p>This chapter tries to explain how the game creates items and what factors affect the creation. Only items generated in the dungeon are discussed. Some of it applies to items created in town as well, but for more details about items created in town, see chapter 3.9. Most of this chapter will not refer specifically to the Hive or the Crypt, but as with much else, they should be equivalent to Caves and Hell. Some quests will give you special items (not counting the special quest items). For information about them, see each individual quest in chapter 8.</p>

<p>In most of the situations below the game has to pick a certain item, prefix/suffix, unique, spell, or other property of an item out of several possible ones or within a range. Unless otherwise noted the probability should be equal for all possible choices in that situation.</p>

<p>Base item in this chapter not only refers to the various equipable items, but also includes scrolls, potions, elixirs, runes, books of and oils of; see chapters 3.1 - 3.2.3 for information about them.</p>

<p>An item can come from many different sources in the dungeon, and depending on the source, the creation routine is a bit different. To facilitate the explanation below let us first define a new term, <I>ilvl.</I> It is defined for various sources in the table below. For information about a monsters mlvl or mlvl<SUB>item</SUB>, see chapters 5.2 and 5.4.</p>

	<sup>4</sup>You will often find potions of various sorts on the ground; they are specially placed there and are not generated according to normal rules.<br>

	<sup>6</sup>Most chests, barrels, pods and urns have an ilvl equal to 2·dlvl, although some have it equal to dlvl. Those that have the ilvl equal to dlvl will only generate potions and scrolls (and oils in Hellfire). See chapter 3.8.1 for more information. Items created with an ilvl = dlvl are referred to as <I>special items</I> in this chapter.

<div class=BodyBold>Special items</div>

<p>Special items appear on those occasions where the item created will not follow normal procedures. Such special items will normally only generate potions and scrolls (in Hellfire it also includes oils). For more information about what base items are possible for special items, see chapter 3.8.3.</p>

<div class=Sub id=3.8.1>3.8.1 What is dropped?</div><br>

<p>First the game has do decide if an item is to be dropped at all, if it is going to be gold or an item. The exact probabilities for these are greatly affected by the source of the item. Each source is explained below.</p>

<div class=Sub id=3.8.3>3.8.3 Item properties</div><br>

<p>Once the base item has been determined, the properties of the item are to be decided. In many cases the item can't have additional properties. That is the case for scrolls, potions, non magical items (as determined by the step above), runes, and some oils (see chapter 3.2.1). If so, this step is not performed. Otherwise, the properties have to be determined, and the procedure depends a bit on what type of item it is. Thus, each item type will be dealt with separately.</p>

<tr>
   <td colspan=3>In single player (but not in multi player) the game keeps track of what unique items have been dropped (or recreated at game start in a characters inventory) and if the same item is determined to be dropped again (or regenerated at game start), the next one with the same qlvl or the one with the next lower qlvl will instead be dropped. Thus in single player you can actually find those &quot;unfindable&quot; unique items but you must find at last one other unique item of the same base item first. The game will forget the list of found unique items when you restart a new game however. The list is saved when you save the game in single player but not restored upon load except for those items you have equipped.</td>

<tr>
   <td colspan=3>The range above means that unless the lower limit is set to 25, the highest qlvl of an item with both a prefix and a suffix can't be more than twice the level of the lower one. This rule is good to know when you want to see if a prefix and a suffix can coexist on an item. It is also worth noticing that as the range above is based on the mlvl, <I>not</I> modified for difficulty level (or 2·dlvl), so the prefix and suffix with the highest qlvl you will ever find in the dungeon has qlvl 34. There is no prefix or suffix in the range of 32-34, so qlvl 31 is the highest one you will find, and only emerald has that qlvl. In Hellfire (but not Diablo), Diablo is level 45, so he can drop items with prefixes and suffixes of qlvl up to 45. Similarly, Na-Krul can drop items with prefixes and suffixes of qlvl up to 44 as he is level 40, and the +4 bonus for being a unique monster applies to him. If for any reason the game fails to select a prefix and/or a suffix, the game will then proceed to create the item as a normal non magical item instead. See chapter 3.13.3 for a list of prefixes and suffixes in the order of their qlvl.</td>
