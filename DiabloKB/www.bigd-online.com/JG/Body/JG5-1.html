<div class=Section>5.1 How to calculate monster data</div><br>

<p>Data for nightmare and hell difficulties is calculated from the data for normal difficulty, and here follows information on how that is done as well as some description of the actual data. All data in the tables for nightmare and hell have been calculated using these formulas. Unique monsters generally follow the same formulas but more detailed information about data for unique monsters is found in chapter 5.4.</p>

   <td class=BodyBold colspan=3>Monster type</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td colspan=3>Each monster can be one of three types: Undead, Animal or Demon. The type they are affects how much damage you do to them. It is summarized in the table below provided by Da O'Toth. The modifiers apply to the whole damage, that is, both to character and weapon damage. If a Bard is holding one sword and one club, the club takes precedence and it counts as having a club, <I>not</I> a sword. The modifications below are done even if the weapon equipped is red, and thus unusable, due to the requirements not being met.</td>

   <td colspan=3>In addition to the above, monster type also affects if a monster will take damage from the spell Holy Bolt. Only undead monsters take damage from it. The only exception is Diablo who is a demon but yet takes damage from Holy Bolt. There are a few magical effects on items that are also dependent on monster type (+200% damage versus demons, extra AC versus undead, and extra AC versus demons, the last two only available in Hellfire). There are no other effects of the monster type.</td>

   <td colspan=3>A monster's level affects many things, including To Hit and experience points given.

For information about this, see chapter 5.4.</td>

   <td colspan=3>First note that all data for hit points is based on the value for normal multi player (even in Hellfire). To calculate the hit points for normal single player, divide the hit points for normal multi player by 2 and round down (1 minimum though). For higher difficulty levels then use:</td>

   <td colspan=3>Note that there is a bug in Diablo previous to v1.07 and in the unpatched Hellfire (v1.00). This bug was &quot;corrected&quot; differently in Hellfire and Diablo. In the tables the hit points for single player are correct for both Diablo and Hellfire (remember that in Diablo, only normal difficulty exists for single player). For multi player, the shown hit points are for Diablo; for Hellfire, you need to add 99 and 197 hit points in nightmare and hell difficulties respectively.</td>

   <td colspan=3>All monsters regenerate hit points. The rate is about 10·mlvl/64 hit points per second. Some monsters might regenerate it faster in some circumstance. Gargoyles, Scavengers and Grave Diggers will all, after having taken a certain amount of damage, move away and start <I>healing</I>. Gargoyles do so when in their stone form, while the other two need a carcass of a monster to eat or dig upon. The table below summarize monster regeneration of hit points.</td>

<tr>
   <td colspan=3>All data for To Hit in the tables are for the physical attacks only. Magic attacks do not use any base To Hit. The damage value is usually used both for melee and magic attacks. For magic attacks, see chapter 4.2. Some monsters have more than one melee attack. Sometime they are connected in the way that each attack animation (that is each attack) has two chances of hitting at different times of the animation. They can hit with both their hands. An example of this is the Lightning Demons. In the other cases it is two different attacks (with two different animations) and the monster can only do one of them at a time. An example of this is the Overlords which can attack with either hand or the Spitting Terrors which can either attack in melee or cast a spell (spit). The table will only hold information about the main melee attack while information about the second melee attack or the spell attack  is given in the notes. Often the second melee attack is sort of crippled in that the base To Hit and damage are both 0 on normal difficulty (and upgraded normally for difficulty) which make it more or less ineffective as it hardly ever hit and when it do it, it do none or neglectable damage.</td>

	   <li>All magic attacks will always check for To Hit, even for spells like Lightning and Inferno.</li>
	   <li>Distance is actually a time count. It goes up by 20 each second. Arrows always have a distance factor, even if they have extra fire or lightning damage. For more information see chapters 4.1.2.</li>
	   <li>To get the final chance of hitting, you subtract the AC of the enemy (normally a player) except if it is a magic attack, of course.</li>

<tr>
   <td colspan=3>Each monster also has an automatic To Hit value, just like players (monsters don't have any chance to automatically miss unless fighting other monsters; in that case, they use the same chance to automatically hit or miss as players do). This indicates the chance of a hit regardless of the player's AC. So even with an AC of 500, monsters will sometimes hit you. The attack can still be blocked, however. The auto To Hit values are listed below.</td>

It may for example seem that the monster get &quot;stuck&quot; and misses the player for way to long time. For more information, see chapter 5.5.8.</li>
