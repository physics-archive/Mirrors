<div class=Section>2.2 Fighting</div><br>

<p>The main activity in Diablo and Hellfire is fighting. You either fight against the monsters or against other players. This chapter will briefly explain how your characters stats and the items you wear affect your character while fighting. For a more detailed explanation on battle between players and monsters, see chapter 5.6.5.</p>

<div class=Sub id=2.2.1>2.2.1 Getting hit</div><br>

<p>When someone or something attacks you, the first step is to see if it hits you or not. Formulas for the chance of hitting a player can be found in chapter 2.1.4 (players), 4.3 (traps) and 5.1 (monsters).</p>
<p>When you are hit by a melee weapon, an arrow, or magic (while not having any resistance), you will try to block the attack (in Hellfire you will try to block even if you have resistance). See chapter 4 for information about what spells can be blocked. To block the attack you must have a shield. A Monk can also block with a staff and with at least one hand bare. If you fail to block or you can't block you will get hit, which will result in damage and the possibility of having to do a hit recovery (getting stunned). For formulas for monsters hitting players, see chapter 5.1.</p>

<p>Damage done by players is composed of two parts, character damage and weapon damage. The character damage is based on your character's stats and can be calculated with the formulas below.

   <li>All Bow character damage is doubled for player versus player except for Rogues.</li>
   <li>There are quite a few bugs associated with fire and lightning arrows which makes them often deal erroneous damage (way too high or no additional damage at all). For more information, see chapter 6.1.6.</li>
   <li>For the Monk, <I>other weapons</I> include just having a shield equiped.</li>
   <li>For the Bard, damage enhancements from the <I>king's</I> and <I>merciless</I> series of prefixes (+% damage) are added together if they occur on both weapons. It is then applied to the sum of both weapons' damage. Damage from enhancements of the <I>slaughter</I> series is only applicable to the weapon it comes on.</li>

   <li>The Barbarian's bonus for not using a shield does not apply if he is using a staff.</li>

<p>As already stated, you add weapon damage to the damage above to get the final damage. Some &quot;weapons&quot; don't have any damage listed and are given below.

<div class=BodyBold>Things that affect damage done</div>

<p>Various things affect the amount of damage a character does. Mostly those things are related to various prefixes, suffixes, or unique properties, but a few exceptions exist. Critical Hits are explained below and type of monster is explained in chapter 5.1. The modifications to the damage can either modify weapon damage alone or your total damage; that is, both your character damage and your weapon damage. In the table below is a list of all modifications that apply to your total damage. They are each cumulative with each other and are applied on top of each other.</p>

<br><br>
<div class=BodyBold>Critical Hit</div>

<p>Warriors and Barbarians have the ability to do a critical hit while doing melee attacks. The chance for a critical hit is clvl% and a critical hit does twice the damage.</p>

<br>
<div class=BodyBold>Adjacent quarter damage</div>

<p>All the new characters in Hellfire have the ability to hit up to three monsters at a time in certain circumstances. It works by dealing ¼<SUP>th</SUP> of the damage to the monsters beside the one you swing at. A separate To Hit check is done for each of those monsters. The To Hit is lowered accordingly to the formula in chapter 2.1.4 under To Hit %. The adjacent quarter damage is done in the following situations:</p>

<ul>
<li>A Monk using a staff.</li>
<li>A Bard using two swords.</li>
<li>A Barbarian using an axe, a two-handed sword or a maul, without having a shield equipped at the same time.</li>
</ul>

<p class=NoInd>Adjacent quarter damage can never hit a player, only monsters.</p>

<br>
<div class=Sub id=2.2.3>2.2.3 Weapon speed</div><br>

<p>A very important factor is how quickly you swing different weapons. A faster weapon not only causes more damage per unit of time, but also helps you stun lock your enemies more easily. Below are listed values for how quickly each character class swings each weapon. Only the Barbarian has different weapon speed for clubs and swords, for all other classes they are identical. The value given is the time in seconds it takes to do one swing.</p>
