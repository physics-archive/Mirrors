<div class=Section>4.1 Spells available to players</div><br>

<p>All spells in Diablo and Hellfire are equally learnable for all character classes. To learn them to a high slvl one needs a high magic attribute, and not all character classes have the ability to reach the needed 255 magic attribute that is needed for the highest spell levels.</p>

<div class=Sub id=4.1.1>4.1.1 List of spells and spell effects</div><br>

<p>Below is a summary of all spells you will find in Diablo and Hellfire. They are arranged in the same way they appear in your spell book. Page 5, Jester, Magi and Mana only exist in Hellfire.</p>

<div class=Sub id=4.1.2>4.1.2 Details about spells</div><br>

<p>Now follows some details about each spell. Not all types of data are applicable for each spell. Below is an explanation of what is told about most spells. If no information type is given for a specific spell, it is either due to it not applying (for example the speed of a stationary effect), or due to it not being known to me. For more details about how spells attack, see chapter 5.6.5 and more specifically chapter 6.1.8.</p>

<p>In previous versions there existed information for spells if they had any distance factor included in their To Hit calculation. From what I have found, no spell has a distance factor; or rather, it is always 0. Only arrows (including fire and lightning arrows and arrows from traps and monsters) have a distance factor. As a consequence, I have removed any reference to a distance in the detailed list of spells.</p>

   <td colspan=3>This means we should, 30 times, calculate Rnd[20] + 1 and add all those 30 values together. For each value, a new random number should be created, for if the same random number would be used, it would have been written as clvl·(Rnd[20] + 1) instead. This sum of 30 values, ranging from 1 to 20 in the example, is the slvl0 which is then used in the recursive formula. It is worth noticing that if there is any random number used in the iterative formula, the result would typically be a distribution of the values as in a bell curve.</td>

As an example a fireball will cause splash damage to all adjacent locations when it hits a wall.</td>

<div class=Sub id=4.1.5>4.1.5 Mana cost and magic requirements for spells</div><br>

<p>Casting spells costs mana and each spell has an initial mana cost at slvl 1. For each slvl the mana cost then decreases by a certain amount specific for each spell until it reaches its minimum mana cost. The table below shows the mana cost for each spell as well as the slvl you reach the minimum mana cost (unless stated otherwise, use the 100% value in the table unless stated otherwise for a character class). Note that Rogues, Monks and Bards only pay 75% of the mana cost (use the 75% value in the table). In Hellfire (after patch 1.01) the Sorcerer only pays 50% of the mana cost (use the 50% value in the table for Hellfire and the 100% value for Diablo). However, no character class ever pays less than the minimum mana cost. Casting spells from scrolls and staves do not cost any mana, but you have to have the required magic to do so.</p>

<p>For staves, the required magic to cast a spell from it is the same as it is to learn the same spell to the first slvl. For scrolls, the mana required to cast a spell is normally a bit less. The table below also shows those required magic levels. For information about prices and slvl of books, scrolls, and staves with spells, see chapter 3.2.3.</p>

<div class=Sub id=4.1.6>4.1.6 Spell level of cast spells</div><br>

<p>When you cast a spell, it will always be cast at the slvl you know the spell plus any additional levels you get from items. As your slvl can go down (by hitting an Enchanted shrine, for example), it is possible to get a known spell to slvl 0. When this happens, you can no longer use the spell, unless some items you are wearing raise the slvl above 0. The slvl can never be negative. Maximum base slvl is 15. With the correct items equipped, the modified slvl can be brought to a maximum of 20.</p>

<p>When casting a spell from a scroll or staff, it will have the same slvl as the slvl you know the spell (including any modifications from items). If you don't know the spell it will be cast at slvl 1 (plus any modifications from items). There is a bug, however. If you cast a spell from a scroll and currently have another spell hot keyed, it will use the slvl of the hot keyed spell instead of the spell you are casting. This is true even if you don't know the spell.</p>

<br>
<br>
<div class=Sub id=4.1.7>4.1.7 Targeting of spells</div><br>

<p>The casting of spells in Diablo and Hellfire is normally easy to do. Just click on the mouse. Some spells need to be targeted, some change the cursor, and others just cast no matter where you are targeting it. The table below is a summary of how different spells behave.</p>

<p>It is worth noticing that there can be a small delay between the time you click on the mouse and the actual cast of the spell. If you change the cursor position during the time in between, or change the spell, you will normally cast the new spell and the target will be the new position of the cursor. Another side effect of this is that the actual mana reduction is done when the spell is cast which may at times lead to mana reaching negative values (the check for enough mana to cast the spell is done when you click the mouse, while the actual reduction is done when it is cast; due to this effect , one can, if one clicks fast enough, end up with negative mana, or be able to cast a spell twice from a scroll, or squeeze out an extra spell from a staff).</p>

      <sup>1</sup>Chain Lightning will produce one lightning bolt that is targeted just as normal lightning. The other bolts are automatically targeted.<br>
      <sup>2</sup>If there is no monster targeted, Stone Curse and Berserk will affect the monster closest to the cursor.<br>
      <sup>3</sup>This spell casts another random spell. See each individual spell for the behavior.<br>
      <sup>4</sup>The direction of the wall is always perpendicular to the caster.
