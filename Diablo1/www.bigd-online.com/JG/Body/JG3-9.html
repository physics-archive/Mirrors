<div class=Section>3.9 Item creation in town</div><br>

<p>For many parts, the creation of items in town is the same as that in the dungeon, but there are several differences and they are explained in this chapter. In the table below are listed what type of items you can buy from each person in town.</p>

<div align=center>
<table class=Left border>
<tr>
   <th>Person</th>
   <th>Items sold<sup>1</sup></th>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>Adria</td>
   <td>staves<sup>2</sup>, books, scrolls, mana potions, rejuvenation potions and elixirs<sup>3</sup></td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>Griswold</td>
   <td>weapons (excluding staves<sup>4</sup>), armor, helms, shields and jewlery<sup>5</sup></td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>Pepin</td>
   <td>healing potions, rejuvenation potions, scroll of resurrect, scroll of healing and elixirs<sup>3,5</sup></td>

   <td>Wirt<sup>6</sup></td>
   <td>weapons (excluding staves<sup>4</sup>), armor, helms, shields and jewlery<sup>5</sup></td>
</tr>
<tfoot>
<tr>
   <td colspan=2>
	<sup>1</sup>Only Griswold and Adria will buy items.<br>
	<sup>2</sup>In Hellfire only with spells.<br>
	<sup>3</sup>Once you are level 26 in multi player or have been to Hell, Crypt, or Hive in single player.<br>
	<sup>4</sup>In Hellfire he does sell staves.<br>
	<sup>5</sup>In single player only.<br>
	<sup>6</sup>For special exceptions regarding Wirt, see chapter 3.9.4.
   </td>
</tr>
</tfoot>
</table>
</div>

<p>Just as for item creation in the dungeon we start by defining the ilvl for each person that you can shop from in town. It is done in the table below.</p>

<div align=center>
<table class=Left border>
<tr>
   <th>Source of item</th>
   <th>Definition of ilvl</th>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>Adria</td>
   <td>special<sup>1</sup></td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>Griswold basic items</td>
   <td>special<sup>1</sup></td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>Griswold premium items</td>
   <td>varying from clvl-1 to clvl+2<sup>2</sup></td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>Pepin</td>
   <td>special<sup>1</sup></td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>Wirt</td>
   <td>clvl</td>
</tr>
<tfoot>
<tr>
   <td colspan=2>
	<sup>1</sup>See table below for how clvl is converted to ilvl in special cases.<br>
	<sup>2</sup>Maximum ilvl is 30 in all cases, though. In Hellfire it varies from clvl-1 to clvl+3. See table below for exact variation.
   </td>
</tr>
</tfoot>
</table>
</div>

<p>As noted in the table above, ilvl is in many cases derived in a special way; the table below explains how it is derived for Adria's, Pepin's and Griswold's basic items. In multi player it depends on your character level. In single player it depends on what dungeon level you have been to in the current game. Difficulty does not affect it in any way.</p>

<p>For Griswold's premium items the ilvl varies depending on what slot the items is created in (in his list of items). The table below explains exactly how.</p>

</div>

<p>When you gain a level, the items in slot 1 and 2 (and 3 in Hellfire) are removed and items are pushed upwards so that slot 4 and 6 becomes empty (slot 11, 13 and 15 in Hellfire). Those empty slots are then refilled with new items of the appropriate ilvl matching the slot.</p>

<p>It is worth noticing that even if two characters are the same level they will be offered different items in town even if they are in the same game. Thus, it can be rewarding to ask others to check for any item you might want if you are playing multi player.</p>

   <td colspan=3>In Hellfire there is an additional factor to consider. If possible he will try to sell items that are better (more expensive than 80% of your most expensive item) than the ones you are already carrying (both equipped ones and not equipped ones). The test is done separately for each item type group (amulet, armor, axe, bow, club, helm, ring, shield, staff and sword). If you don't have any item of a type, any other item of that type is considered to be better. Thus to get progressively better items you should keep the most expensive item of each item type in your inventory. This check for better items is also done for items that are created to fill up a slot after you have leveled or bought one of his items. Also note that this works in Hellfire only. Sometimes you will see an item &quot;violating&quot; this rule in Hellfire, as the game only tries a specific number of times, and if it has not found an item that matches in those tries it sticks with whatever item it generates next.</td>
