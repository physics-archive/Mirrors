<div class=Section>2.8 Character names</div><br>

<p>When you create a character, you also have to give it a name. Depending on if it is a single or multi player character, the characters that are allowed to use in the name differ slightly. The table below summarize all allowed characters.</p>

<div align=center>
<table class=Left border>

	<sup>1</sup>By localized characters are meant characters that are specific for various non English languages. Examples are: &aring;&auml;&ouml;&uuml;&acirc;&atilde;&iuml;, and many others. Such localized characters are still possible to enter when you create the character, but there will be an error message when you finish typing in the name.
